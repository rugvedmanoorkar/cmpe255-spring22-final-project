## Introduction
## Models
1. SVM
2. Random Forest
## Dataset and Preprocessing
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

We start with 2000 samples from the Mendeley dataset.
1000 positive samples (x-rays labeled pneumonia)
1000 negative samples (x-rays labelled as not pneumonia)

These samples are high quality JPEG images. We use python OpenCV library to resize these images and then convert to grayscale inorder to reduce the complexity. All the pneumonia positive samples are labelled as 1 and negative samples are labelled as 0.
